Hey there!

Samagra (Sammy) this side. I am glad to meet you. I grew up reading Sanskrit texts in the dusty lanes of Guna, a small town in Central India.

Currently, I am a researcher. I like to study about intelligent systems, computing, physics and probabilistic modelling. I am about to graduate from IIT Roorkee. Post my bachelor's, I will soon be joining a full PhD program in Computer Systems.

Previously, I researched at Adobe Big Data Lab on Multimodal Content Generation and at UCSB Systems and Networks laboratory on Intelligent Query Planning. I am also associated with Aimacode, where I worked once as a Student Developer and once as a Mentor and Org Admin.

When I am not busy optimising my systems, you can find me playing the Ukulele, writing my heart out or performing at the Dramatics Section, IIT Roorkee.

I like to meet and interact with new people, so don't hesitate to ask me out for coffee. I can talk about philosophy, intelligence, rationality, Krishna, love, life and can listen for hours. In short I am ideal for a coffee date. So hit me up using the channels below and we will have an awesome time.
